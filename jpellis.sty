%% Maths
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Provide some generic maths shortcuts.  These include:
%%
%% - \e
%%   Shorthand for '\cdot 10^'
%%
%% - \vt, \uv
%%   For vectors, unit vectors and phasors, displaying them in bold and with the
%%   hat as appropriate.  The unit vectors 'i' and 'j' use the special \imath and
%%   \jmath which do not feature the dot.
%%
%% - \dd, \ddbar and \dD
%%   Upright 'd' for derivatives, d/(2p) and 'D'
%%
%% - \st, \pcc, \phc
%%   Shorthand for 'such that', '+ complex conjugate' and '+ Hermitian
%%   conjugate'.  In each case, they are realized as: s.t., + c.c., + h.c.
%%
%% - \pfrac, \ddfrac
%%   Shorthand for complete and partial derivative fractions.  For example
%%   \pfrac{^2 y}{x^2} will result in \frac{\partial^2 y}{x^2}.
%%
%% - \inR, \inZ, \inC, \inQ, \inN Shorthand for 'in reals', 'in integers', 'in
%%   complex', 'in rational', 'in natural'.
%%
%% - \bmtx, \vmtx, \pmtx
%%   Shorthands for the various matrix environments.
\ifjpellis@maths
  %% Provides the exponent shorthand in scientific notation.
