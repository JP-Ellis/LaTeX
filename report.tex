\section{Introduction}

\Gls{latex} is a program designed to typeset documents.  Unlike programs such as
\href{http://office.microsoft.com/en-au/word/}{Microsoft Word} and
\href{http://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer/}{LibreOffice Writer}, LaTeX
makes an effort to ensure that everything is placed correctly with the
appropriate spacing.

\subsection{Mathematics}
\label{subsec:mathematics}

LaTeX also handles mathematics very nicely.  For example, I can write Einstein's
most famous equation inline: \(E = mc^2\), and the size of the symbols is scaled
appropriate, as demonstrated with Newton's second law: \(\vt F = \ddfrac{\vt
    p}{t}\).  Contrast the small fraction with the alternative inline notation:
\(\vt F = \dd \vt p / \dd t\), where no scaling is required.

Equations can also be placed on the own line within a text if they are a little
cumbersome to write inline, such the Schr\"odinger equation:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:schrodinger_equation}
    i \hbar \pfrac{\Psi(\vt x, t)}{t} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \Psi(\vt x, t) + V(\vt x, t) \Psi(\vt x, t)
\end{equation}
and if I have multiple equations, they can be aligned nicely as demonstrated
with Maxwell's equations:
\begin{subequations}
    \label{eq:Maxwell_equations}
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:Gauss_law}\withnumber
        \nabla \cdot \vt E &= \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0} \\
        \label{eq:Gauss_law_magnetism}\withnumber
        \nabla \cdot \vt B &= 0 \\
        \label{eq:Maxwell-Faraday_equation}\withnumber
        \nabla \times \vt E &= - \pfrac{\vt B}{t} \\
        \label{eq:Ampere_law}\withnumber
        \nabla \times \vt B &= \mu_0 \vt J + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \pfrac{\vt E}{t}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

\gls{latex} also takes care of all the referencing with \verb|\label{}| and
\verb|\ref{}|.  Schr\"odinger's equation for example is equation
\eqref{eq:schrodinger_equation}, whilst Maxwell's equations are listed under
\eqref{eq:Maxwell_equations} and Amp\`ere's law in particular is
\eqref{eq:Ampere_law}.

\subsection{Glossary and Bibliography}
\label{subsec:glossary_and_bibliography}

\Gls{latex}'s referencing capabailities do not end referencing particular equation
(c.f.~\S\ref{subsec:mathematics}) but can also be used to refer to particular
sections.  Additionally with the aid of external programs, in depth
cross-referencing of terms in order to produce a \gls{glossary} is possible.

More commonly, LaTeX is used in combination with \gls{bibtex} and \gls{biber} to
produce bibliographies.  This automatically takes care of inserting the proper
reference to some article \cite{Smith2013}, and I can easily cite the author and
year of the article: \citeauthor{Smith2013}, \citeyear{Smith2013}.
