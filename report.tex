%% All LaTeX documents begin with the the `\documentclass` command which serves
%% to set the general style of the document.  It defines the page layout, the
%% chapter/section styles, how figures appear, etc. and may provide some
%% additional environments too.  LaTeX comes with four main classes: `article`,
%% `report`, `book` and `letter`.
%%
%% The [koma-script](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/koma-script) package provides
%% alternatives to replacements for the default classes (`scrartcl`, `scrreprt`,
%% `scrbook`, `scrlttr2`) and provides a lot of options to more easily customize the
%% layout of the page.

%% In general, LaTeX commands start with `\` and consist of letters only.
%% Optional parameters are specified in brackets `[]`, whilst compulsory
%% arguments (if any) are specified in braces `{}`.
\documentclass[twoside, onecolumn, portait, bibliography=totoc, parskip=half*]{scrartcl}
%% Some common optional arguments to the document class are listed below.  The
%% defaults depend on the class use (so see the Koma scripts for bibliography
%% and parskip).
%%
%% - 10pt, 11pt, 12pt
%%   Sets the font size
%%
%% - a4paper, letterpaper, a5paper, ...
%%   Sets the page size, though the `geometry` package allows these options to be
%%   fine-tuned.
%%
%% - onecolumn, twocolumn
%%   Use a one- or two-column layout in the document
%%
%% - oneside, twoside
%%   Formats the pages to be printed either one-sided or two-sided
%%
%% - portait, landscape
%%   Defines the orientation of the page
%%
%% - draft, final
%%   Draft modes highlights some errors in the output, and does not include
%%   pictures (which can save a lot of time in a document with many pictures).
%%
%%
%% The part of the document starting from here through to the
%% `\begin{document}` command is called the preamble.  This is where you include
%% additional packages which provide additional functionalities.  Below are many
%% packages which I personally use at some point or another.
%%
%% More information about nearly every package can be found at
%% ctan.org/pkg/<pkg-name>.

\usepackage[UKenglish]{babel} % Set up the language
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}      % Required for better PDF output
\usepackage{siunitx}          % Provides \SI{1}{\metre}, also \ang{90}.

%% Graphics & Figure
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\usepackage{graphicx}   % Allow graphics to be included
\usepackage{xcolor}     % Define and use colours

% \usepackage{tikz}       % Powerful drawing language
% \usepackage{pgfplots}   % Plotting with LaTeX

%% TikZ pictures and plots can significantly increase the time it takes to
%% produce the output.  The `external` TikZ library library defers the creation
%% of these figures to a sub-process which creates a separate PDF file which is
%% then simply imported into the main document.  To call the sub-process, you
%% have to execute the appropriate makefile.  If you are using LatexMk, you can
%% use the `.latexmkrc` to automatically do this for you.
%%
%% The following setup works on Linux, and should work on OS X too.
% \usetikzlibrary{external}
% \tikzexternalize[shell escape=-shell-escape, prefix=pgf-img/]
% \immediate\write18{mkdir -p pgf-img}

\section{Introduction}

\Gls{latex} is a program designed to typeset documents.  Unlike programs such as
\href{http://office.microsoft.com/en-au/word/}{Microsoft Word} and
\href{http://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer/}{LibreOffice Writer}, LaTeX
makes an effort to ensure that everything is placed correctly with the
appropriate spacing.

\subsection{Mathematics}
\label{subsec:mathematics}

\Gls{latex} also handles mathematics very nicely; for example, I can write
Einstein's most famous equation inline: \(E = mc^2\).  Inline maths in \LaTeX~is
scaled appropriately so that it fits the line as can be demonstrated with
Newton's second law: \(\vt F = \ddfrac{\vt p}{t}\).  Newton's second law could
also be written at \(\vt F = \dd \vt p / \dd t\), where no scaling is required.

Equations can also be placed on the own line within a text if they are a little
cumbersome to write inline, such the Schr\"odinger equation:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:schrodinger_equation}
    i \hbar \pfrac{\Psi(\vt x, t)}{t} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \Psi(\vt x, t) + V(\vt x, t) \Psi(\vt x, t).
\end{equation}
When there are multiple equations, these can be aligned nicely to make it
clearer.  The location which is aligned is done at the symbol after the
\verb|&|; typically, this is done at the equal sign as shown with Maxwell's
equation:
\begin{subequations}
    \label{eq:Maxwell_equations}
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:Gauss_law}\withnumber
        \nabla \cdot \vt E &= \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0} \\
        \label{eq:Gauss_law_magnetism}\withnumber
        \nabla \cdot \vt B &= 0 \\
        \label{eq:Maxwell-Faraday_equation}\withnumber
        \nabla \times \vt E &= - \pfrac{\vt B}{t} \\
        \label{eq:Ampere_law}\withnumber
        \nabla \times \vt B &= \mu_0 \vt J + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \pfrac{\vt E}{t}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

\LaTeX~also takes care of all the referencing with \verb|\label{}| and
\verb|\ref{}|.  Schr\"odinger's equation for example is equation
\eqref{eq:schrodinger_equation}, whilst Maxwell's equations are listed under
\eqref{eq:Maxwell_equations} and Amp\`ere's law in particular is
\eqref{eq:Ampere_law}.

\subsection{Glossary and Bibliography}
\label{subsec:glossary_and_bibliography}

\Gls{latex}'s referencing capabailities do not end referencing particular equation
(c.f.~\S\ref{subsec:mathematics}) but can also be used to refer to particular
sections.  Additionally with the aid of external programs, in depth
cross-referencing of terms in order to produce a \gls{glossary} is possible.

More commonly, LaTeX is used in combination with \gls{bibtex} and \gls{biber} to
produce bibliographies.  This automatically takes care of inserting the proper
reference to some article \cite{Smith2013}, and I can easily cite the author and
year of the article: \citeauthor{Smith2013}, \citeyear{Smith2013}.
